<p>I struggled a lot with the project. I wanted to animate individual parts of each Pokémon and learned very quickly that I was working with too complicated of a concept. I had to simplify my design many times before I landed on the final design. There is a lot more I hope to change about the design, but I feel like a landed on a very good starting point. I am proud of the animations and think they work very well to portray the liveliness of the Pokémon. </p>
